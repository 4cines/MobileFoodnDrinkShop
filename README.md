# ShopAppMobile-backend

This mobile application aims to purchase various food products.

Using an existing database, I created an API with Node.js and Express.

3. Clone the repository
4. Import shopappmobiledb.sql in ShopAppMobileDB database
5. Run "npm i" in the Visual Studio Code console

## Status
IN PROGRESS...
