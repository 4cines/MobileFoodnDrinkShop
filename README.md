# ShopAppMobile-backend

This mobile application aims to purchase various food products.

Using an existing database, I created an API with Node.js and Express.

## Deployment
1. Create a new MySQL database (ShopAppMobileDB)
3. Clone the repository
4. Import shopappmobiledb.sql in your MySQL Workbench
5. Run "npm i" in the Visual Studio Code console
6. Run "npm run start".

## Status
IN PROGRESS...
