# ShopAppMobile-backend

This mobile application aims to purchase various food products.

Using an existing database, I created an API with Node.js and Express.

2. Clone the repository.
3. Run "npm i."
4. Run "npm initDB" in the Visual Studio Code console.
5. Run "npm run start in the Visual Studio Code console.

## Status
IN PROGRESS...
