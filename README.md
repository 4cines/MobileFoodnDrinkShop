## Description
This API, created with Node.js and Express, has been developed for a wholesale food and beverage company. In its database, it contains information about all products, customers, and other related information to manage orders. This app allows managing requests so that registered customers from the frontend can place orders and save lists of orders to be processed periodically. There is also a section where orders are recorded, and you can access their history.
